To reproduce the results from the Alignment by Agreement paper:

- Get the Hansards data and put it in the data directory as shown in files.list.
- Run crossTrain on naacl06.conf
- The out directory contains some files which shows you what you should get.
  The best AER attained is by setting the posteriorThreshold to 0.39,
  which yields an AER of 5.1574 on the development set.
  Using this threshold on the finaltest yields an AER of 4.9351.
